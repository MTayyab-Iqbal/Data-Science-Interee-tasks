# **Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Reviews**

## **Overview**

This project implements a simple sentiment analysis model using a dataset of 50000 IMDB reviews. The model classifies reviews as either positive or negative using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a Logistic Regression classifier.

## **Dataset**

The dataset consists of 50000 IMDB movie reviews labeled as positive or negative. The text data undergoes preprocessing and feature extraction before being fed into the model.

## **Steps Performed**

### 1. Preprocessing

Converted text to lowercase.

Removed stopwords and special characters.

### 2. Feature Engineering

Used CountVectorizer to transform text into a numerical representation.

### 3. Model Training

Implemented a Logistic Regression model to classify reviews as positive or negative.

### 4. Model Evaluation

Evaluated the model using accuracy.

Optional metrics such as precision and recall can be computed.
