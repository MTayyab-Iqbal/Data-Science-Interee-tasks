# **House Price Prediction using Linear Regression**

## Description

This project predicts house prices using the Boston Housing Dataset with a Linear Regression model. The dataset contains various features of houses, such as crime rate, number of rooms, and location characteristics, which are used to estimate house prices.

## Features

**Preprocessing:** Normalization of numerical features using StandardScaler.

**Model Training:** Implements a simple Linear Regression model.

**Evaluation:** Uses Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess model performance.

## Dataset

The project uses the Boston Housing Dataset.

## Implementation Steps

* Load the Boston Housing Dataset.

* Normalize the features using StandardScaler.

* Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

* Train a Linear Regression model.

* Predict house prices on the test set.

* Evaluate the model using RMSE.
