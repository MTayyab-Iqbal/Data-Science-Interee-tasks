Introduction

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover insights about passenger survival. Basic visualizations were used to analyze the relationships between features and survival outcomes.


---

Dataset Information

Source: The Titanic dataset was obtained from Seaborn library.

Description: The dataset contains information about Titanic passengers, including demographic details, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

Key Features:

Survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Pclass: Ticket class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third)

Sex: Gender of the passenger

Age: Age of the passenger

Fare: Amount paid for the ticket

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)




---

Objective

The goal of this project is to:

Perform data cleaning and preprocessing.

Visualize data using bar charts, histograms, and correlation heatmaps.

Summarize key insights from the dataset.



---

Tools and Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used in the project:

Pandas: Data manipulation and cleaning.

Matplotlib: Plotting graphs and visualizations.

Seaborn: Advanced visualizations and heatmaps.



---

Steps Performed

1. Loading the Dataset: Read the Titanic dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.


2. Data Cleaning:

Filled missing values in the Age and Embarked columns.

Removed the deck column due to excessive missing data.

Dropped duplicate rows (if any).



3. Data Visualization:

Bar chart for survival count.

Histogram for age distribution.

Correlation heatmap of numerical features.



4. Summary of Insights: Highlighted relationships between survival and other features.

Key Findings

1. Passengers who paid higher fares had a better chance of survival.


2. First-class passengers were more likely to survive than those in lower classes.


3. Age did not significantly influence survival chances.


4. Most passengers traveling in groups (e.g., with family) had weak correlations with survival.
